# Model-Accuracy-on-Churm-Modeling-Dataset
A deep Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Churm Modeling dataset and check the accuracy on model 
In the Project, I have done the following Steps:
* Reading and understanding of Data
* Data Cleaning and Preparation
* Visualizing the Data
* Deriving the Data
* Train-Test Split and Feature Scaling
* Model Building
* Accuracy and Evaluation
